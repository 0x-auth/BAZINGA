# BAZINGA Project

## Overview
BAZINGA (Bazaar-Inspired Neural Growth and Analysis) is a comprehensive system for pattern recognition, fractal knowledge integration, quantum linguistics analysis, and lambda-driven self-modifying execution.

## Key Components

### Lambda-Driven Self-Modifying Execution System
- 5-dimensional pattern expansion (Structure, Temporality, Contextuality, Emergence, Trust)
- Trust dimension (V-axis) integration
- Dynamic lambda derivation from patterns
- Pattern-based meta-programming
- Self-modifying execution capabilities
- Fractal mathematics for deterministic pattern generation
- Mandelbrot/Julia set integration for all five dimensions

### Quantum Pattern Recognition
- Analyze code through quantum linguistics
- Self-improving pattern detection
- Fractal dimension approximations

### Fractal Knowledge Library
- Universal Pattern Library (UPL)
- Time-based trust analysis
- Knowledge expansion through self-reference

### Integration Points
- cld AI connector
- SSRI system integration
- Git-based version control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Python 3.8+
- Bash environment

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhissrivasta/BAZINGA.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
./bin/bazinga-controller.sh setup
```

### Usage
```bash
# Run the main controller
./bin/bazinga-controller.sh

# Run the quantum analyzer on a codebase
./quantum-architecture-analyzer.sh /path/to/codebase

# Use the UPL command-line tool
./bin/upl-analyze pattern-name

# Try the new Lambda system
./run-lambda-test.sh                # Run the lambda system tests
./run-lambda-interactive.sh         # Launch interactive lambda shell
./run-lambda-visualization.sh       # Open visualization of the lambda patterns
./run-fractal-lambda-test.sh        # Test the fractal-lambda integration
```
