# Fundamental Limitations of Traditional GenAI

Traditional generative AI models face several inherent limitations in language understanding that quantum linguistics addresses:

## 1. Representation Limitations

Traditional models represent language with:
- Real-valued vectors only (no complex phases)
- Fixed-dimensional embedding spaces
- Deterministic transformations

This fundamentally limits their ability to model:
- Semantic interference effects
- Quantum-like contextual collapse
- Non-commutative aspects of meaning

## 2. Context Processing Limitations

While attention mechanisms provide powerful context integration, they still:
- Process words sequentially rather than in superposition
- Apply deterministic weighting to context
- Cannot represent multiple simultaneous interpretations with proper probability distributions

## 3. Phase Blindness

Traditional models cannot represent semantic phase information, which is critical for:
- Subtle nuance detection
- Distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences
- Modeling how meaning combinations create interference patterns

These limitations aren't simply engineering challenges but fundamental restrictions from the mathematical foundations of current architectures.
