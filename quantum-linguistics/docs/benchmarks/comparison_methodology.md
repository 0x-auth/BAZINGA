# Quantum Linguistics vs. Traditional GenAI: Benchmark Methodology

This document outlines our approach to comparing quantum linguistics with traditional generative AI models on language understanding tasks.

## Key Comparative Dimensions

1. **Ambiguity Resolution**: How well models resolve ambiguous words/phrases in context
2. **Contextual Interference**: Detection of meaning shifts from competing contexts
3. **Non-locality**: Ability to maintain coherent meaning across distant parts of text
4. **Phase Sensitivity**: Response to subtle shifts in semantic emphasis

## Ambiguity Test Cases

We use polysemous words in varying contexts to measure disambiguation accuracy:

| Word | Context A | Context B | Quantum Advantage |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| bank | river     | financial | Phase-sensitive context detection |
| run  | exercise  | execute   | Superposition of active meanings |
| light| brightness| weight    | Interference patterns in resolution |
