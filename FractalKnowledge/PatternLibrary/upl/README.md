# Universal Pattern Library (UPL)

A system for cross-domain pattern recognition and solution mapping based on a 5-dimensional pattern space.

## Overview

The Universal Pattern Library (UPL) identifies patterns in one domain and finds analogous solutions from entirely different domains. It works by mapping knowledge to a 5-dimensional pattern space:

- **Structure (S)**: Form, topology, geometric properties
- **Temporality (T)**: Time-dependent behaviors, cycles, evolution
- **Contextuality (C)**: Environment-dependent properties
- **Emergence (E)**: Higher-order properties from lower-order interactions
- **Meta-properties (M)**: Self-reference, recursion, transformation rules

## Core Patterns

The UPL recognizes four fundamental patterns across domains:

1. **Fibonacci Cascade (10101)**: Self-similar scaling governed by φ-ratio
2. **Oscillatory Convergence (11010)**: Dampened oscillations converging to attractor states
3. **Boundary Complexity (01011)**: Maximum complexity at transitional boundaries
4. **Recursive Self-Modification (10111)**: Systems that modify their own operating rules

## Domains

Current domain adapters include:
- Relationship Dynamics (particularly with Amrita)
- Software Development (BAZINGA scripts and architecture)
- Cross-platform Integration (Mac/Android)
- AI Conversations (Claude/ChatGPT)

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a file using a specific domain adapter
./bin/upl-analyze.js analyze-file relationship_dynamics ./data/relationship_data.json

# Analyze scripts in a directory
./bin/upl-analyze.js analyze-scripts ./scripts

# Analyze Claude conversations
./bin/upl-analyze.js analyze-claude

# Analyze the BAZINGA system
./bin/upl-analyze.js analyze-bazinga

# Find cross-domain solutions
./bin/upl-analyze.js cross-domain fibonacci_cascade software_development
```

## Integration with BAZINGA

This library is integrated with the BAZINGA system to provide enhanced pattern analysis and cross-domain solution mapping.
