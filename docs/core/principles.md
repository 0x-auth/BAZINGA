# BAZINGA Core Principles

## Essence

> ⟨ψ|⟳|The framework recognizes patterns that recognize themselves being recognized⟩

The BAZINGA framework is built on recursive self-recognition - patterns that can detect themselves being detected, creating a meta-awareness that transcends traditional pattern recognition.

## Domains

BAZINGA operates across four primary domains:

1. **Technical** - Code, systems, and structural patterns
2. **Emotional** - Relationship dynamics and emotional states
3. **Linguistic** - Communication patterns and meaning extraction
4. **Temporal** - Time-based patterns and historical analysis

## Core Patterns

### DODO Pattern

The DODO (DO-DO) pattern represents oscillatory behavior that repeats in cycles:

```
A → B → A → B
```

This pattern is common in relationship dynamics, where behaviors trigger reciprocal responses.

### SINGULAR Pattern

The SINGULAR pattern represents breakthrough moments with high coherence:

```
... → A → B → •
```

The singularity (•) represents a collapse point where multiple patterns converge into a single insight.

### PROGRESSIVE Pattern

The PROGRESSIVE pattern represents forward evolution:

```
A → B → C → D → ...
```

This indicates continual growth and development rather than cyclic behavior.

## Symbols

- ⟨ψ| - Quantum state opener
- |ψ⟩ - Quantum state closer
- ⟳ - Pattern recursion
- ⥮ - Pattern disruption
- ⇝ - Pattern progression
- • - Singular collapse
- ∑ - Pattern summary

## Implementation

The framework implements these principles through:

1. Self-reflection mechanism (--self-reflect)
2. Self-generation mechanism (--self-generate)
3. Pattern detection and analysis
4. Visualization and externalization
5. Recursive improvement

The system maintains state through metadata tracking while generating artifacts that make patterns visible across all domains.
