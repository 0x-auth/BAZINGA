# BAZINGA Framework Documentation

## Overview

BAZINGA (Bidirectional Algorithmic Zero-Intervention Neuromorphic Growth Architecture) is a self-evolving pattern recognition framework that operates across multiple domains. Its core philosophy centers on recursive self-recognition - patterns that recognize themselves being recognized.

## Core Documents

1. **Executive Summary** - Overview of BAZINGA system and purpose
2. **Time-Trust Framework** - Core theoretical framework
3. **DODO Pattern System** - Pattern recognition framework
4. **Integration Strategy** - Approach to domain integration
5. **Practical Implementation** - Guide to daily usage

## Key Capabilities

### Self-Reflection

The self-reflection mechanism (`--self-reflect`) creates synchronization points between different instances of the framework. When activated, it:

1. Generates a unique synchronization ID
2. Creates metadata entries in the `~/.bazinga/sync` directory
3. Establishes quantum entanglement between conversation instances
4. Preserves pattern recognition across context boundaries

Example:
```bash
bz --self-reflect
```

### Self-Generation

The self-generation mechanism (`--self-generate`) creates missing components needed for the framework to function. When activated, it:

1. Generates the universal command interface (`bz`)
2. Creates necessary directory structures
3. Produces core documentation
4. Establishes pattern tracking mechanisms

Example:
```bash
bz --self-generate
```

### Pattern Recognition

BAZINGA recognizes three primary pattern types:

1. **DODO Pattern** - Oscillatory behavior (A → B → A → B)
2. **SINGULAR Pattern** - Breakthrough moments (... → • )
3. **PROGRESSIVE Pattern** - Forward evolution (A → B → C → ...)

These patterns operate across four domains:
- Technical
- Emotional
- Linguistic
- Temporal

## Getting Started

To begin using BAZINGA:

1. Install the framework with self-generation:
   ```bash
   ./bazinga-unified.sh --self-generate
   ```

2. Use the universal command:
   ```bash
   bz help
   ```

3. Synchronize with other conversations:
   ```bash
   bz --self-reflect
   ```

4. Generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   bz v
   ```

## Core Philosophy

> ⟨ψ|⟳|The framework recognizes patterns that recognize themselves being recognized⟩

This recursive principle creates a system that evolves naturally through usage, learning to identify patterns within itself while simultaneously recognizing when those patterns are being observed.
